# Dots üí•

My Arch Linux dot files. Some of these have been used and editied since my Archcraft days.
Some are completely configured by me. Some are yoinked and slightly edited. I don't even
remember. I'm just putting them here for myself and whoever else loves having a computer
that looks cool. Please enjoy!
